# AttendanceMonitor

**AttendEaze** is an attendance monitoring and management system built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS, PostgreSQL, and other technologies. 
It is a web-based application that allows teachers or instructors to take attendance quickly and easily, and for students to view their attendance records.

**Features:**
* Attendance reports: Teachers can generate detailed attendance reports for individual students or classes.
* Real-time updates: Attendance data is updated in real time, so that teachers and students can always see the most up-to-date information.

**Setup:**

To set up AttendEaze, you will need:

* A PostgreSQL database
* A Node.js server
* ReactJS installed on your machine

Once you have all of the prerequisites installed, you can clone the AttendEaze repository and install the dependencies:

```
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/AttendEaze.git
cd AttendEaze
npm install
```

To start the development server, run:

```
npm start
```

The AttendEaze application will now be running on your local machine. You can access it at `http://localhost:3000`.

**Usage:**

To use AttendEaze, teachers will need to create an account and add their students. Once students have been added, teachers can generate QR codes for their classes. Students can then scan these QR codes to mark their attendance.

Teachers can view attendance reports for individual students or classes at any time. Attendance reports show the date and time that each student marked their attendance, as well as any proxy detections.

**Deployment:**

To deploy AttendEaze to a production environment, you can use a cloud hosting provider such as Heroku or AWS.

To deploy AttendEaze to Heroku, create a new Heroku app and add the following build and run scripts to the `package.json` file:

```json
"build": "npm run build",
"start": "node index.js"
```

Then, deploy the app to Heroku:

```
heroku create
git push heroku main
```

Once the app has been deployed, you can access it at the Heroku URL assigned to your app.
